Containous has announced a release candidate for Traefik 2.3, codenamed Picodon. The release brings two significant features: a new SaaS platform and middleware plugin management.

If you are not familiar with Traefik, it is a powerful reverse proxy built purposely for the cloud. Similar to NGINX, with features that provide a unique advantage for those who desire auto discovery in a highly containerized world. 

## Traefik Pilot
A new SaaS global control plane, introduced to simplify the management of Traefil running in a production environment. Traefik Pilot provides a powerful obervability and control plane for every one of your Traefik instances in a single unified dashboard. Clearly targeted at more enterprise use cases, the dashboard will make running and managing multiple instance of Traefik much easier.

## Middleware Plugin Management
In addition to the new dashboard introduced with Pilot, a brand new plugins marketplace is available.

Traefik has been a fascinating new entry into reverse proxies, disrupting kings like NGINX. These two new features will further mature the product for those choosing ingress proxies for Kubernetes.
