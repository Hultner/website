    Learn how to check a Docker container's memory and CPU utilization, as well as network traffic and disk I/O to ensure everything is running fine.
---

In this tutorial, you are going to learn how to use the `docker` command to check memory and CPU utilization of your running Docker containers.

Monitoring the health of your containers is crucial for a happy and reliable environment. It's very important to know if your container is hittings its head against a CPU, Memory, Network, or Block limit, which could be severely degrading it. 

## Docker Stats
The Docker command-line tool has a `stats` command the gives you a live look at your containers resource utilization. We can use this tool to gauge the CPU, Memory, Networok, and disk utilization of every running  container.

Run the `docker stats` command to display the status of your containers.

```shell
docker stats
```
```shell
CONTAINER ID        NAME                                                                                       CPU %               MEM USAGE / LIMIT     MEM %               NET I/O             BLOCK I/O           PIDS

```

* Memory is listed under the **MEM USAGE / LIMIT** column. This provides a snapshot of how much memory the container is utilizing and what it's memory limit is.
* CPU utilization is listed under the **CPU %** column.
* Network traffic is represented under the **NET I/O** column. It displays the outgoing and incoming traffic consumption of a container.
* Storage utilization is shown under the **BLOCK I/O** column. This show you the amount of reads and writes a container is peforming to disk.

## No Stream
By default, the `docker stats` command will display a live stream of stats. If you would prefer outputting the first stats pull results, use the `--no-stream` flag.

```shell
docker stats --no-stream
```
```
CONTAINER ID        NAME                                                                                       CPU %               MEM USAGE / LIMIT     MEM %               NET I/O             BLOCK I/O           PIDS

```

## All Containers
By default, `docker stats` will only output results for running containers. If you would like to output stats for all containers you can use the `-a` or `--all` flags with the command.

```shell
docker stats --no-stream -a
```

You maybe wondering why someone would want to output stats for containers that are not running. One use case is ensuring that a container is no longer running, or displaying a list of stopped containers with the running containers and their stats.

## Conclusion
The native Docker tools provide a limited glimps into the health of your containers, but its enough to understand how each one is utilizing system resources. We determine whether a container is CPU or Memory blocked, how much network traffic is hitting or being generated by a container, and how hard it's disk storage is being hit.
