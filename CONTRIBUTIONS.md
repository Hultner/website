**First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!**

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Kubernetes documentation, hosted at Kubernetes.io. These are just guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Before you get started
### Code of Conduct
Kubernetes follows the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Code of Conduct](). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the [Kubernetes Code of Conduct Committee]() [conduct@kubernetes.io]().

### Documentation and Site Decisions
The [Kubernetes SIG Docs Discussion Group]() is the discussion group for doc releases, suggested site improvements, and improving the doc contribution experience. If you are planning to be a regular contributor, join this group to stay informed and involved.

### Style Guides and Templates
Before submitting a pull request to create new content, please review the [Kubernetes.io style guide]() and follow the [instructions for using page templates]().

## Contributing to Tutorials
### Reporting Tutorial Issues
Kubernetes.io uses github issues to track documentation issues and requests. If you see a documentation issue, submit an issue using the following steps:

1. Check the [kubernetes.io issues list]() as you might find out the issue is a duplicate.
1. Use the [included template for every new issue](). When you create a bug report, include as many details as possible and include suggested fixes to the issue.

Note that code issues should be filed against the main kubernetes repository, while documentation issues should go in the kubernetes.io repository.

### Submitting Documentation Pull Requests
If you're fixing an issue in the existing documentation, you should submit a PR against the master branch. Follow [these instructions to create a documentation pull request against the kubernetes.io repository]().
